# Copenhagen Jacket Decision Maker

Danish weather is very uncertain, so I made this app to help me decide what jacket to wear based on weather data. 
It also help me know when it gets cold enough to take gloves or when I should be prepared for rain.

## What Jacket to wear?

- **Datetime**: {get_now_cph_str()}
- **Recommended Jacket Type**: {jacket}
- **Take a Rain Jacket?** {rain_jacket}
- **Take Gloves?** {gloves}

## Weather Forecast
- Avg Feels Like Temperature: {avg_feels_temp} Â°C
